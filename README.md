# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars based on features like year of registration, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and kilometers driven.

It was developed using Jupyter Notebook and is part of a larger effort to build practical, real-world machine learning skills.
