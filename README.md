## 📝 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter: [car_price_prediction.ipynb](./car_price_prediction.ipynb).  
2. Upload the dataset: [`car data.csv`](./car%20data.csv)
3. Run the cells step by step

## 📌 Output Example

- Random Forest Regressor performed best with high accuracy.
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values shows a good fit.

---

## 📊Future Work
- Incorporate more features like car condition, location, and seller type.
- Experiment with advanced models such as XGBoost and Gradient Boosting.
- Develop a user-friendly web app to allow interactive car price predictions.
